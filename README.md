# Blinkit_Quick_Commerce_Performance
Data visualization and performance analysis for Blinkit's Quick Commerce operations. This project dissects key metrics like Total Sales, Average Rating, and Item Visibility, segmenting performance across different Outlet Types, Store Sizes, and Product Categories to identify core growth drivers.

## Problem Statement
Identify the key drivers of sales performance, average rating, and item visibility across different outlet types, sizes, and product categories to develop actionable strategies for maximizing total sales and profitability while maintaining high customer satisfaction.

## KPI's
These are the essential metrics tracked by the dashboard, categorized for clarity:

**1. High-Level Financial & Satisfaction KPIs** 

These provide an instant health check of the business.
- Total Sales: The primary measure of revenue success.
- Average Sales: Indicates the average value of a customer's purchase or item sale.
- Average Rating: The overall metric for customer experience and satisfaction.
- No. Of Items: Tracks the inventory scale or product variety.

**2. Operational & Segmented Sales KPIs**

These KPIs help isolate performance strengths and weaknesses across the business segments.
- Sales by Outlet Type: Comparing the performance of Grocery Stores, Supermarket Type 1, and Supermarket Type 2 (e.g., Supermarket Type 1 generates the highest sales at $\$787.55K$).
- Item Visibility by Outlet Type: Measures how easily products are found by customers in different store formats.
- Sales by Item Type: Identifying the top-contributing product categories (e.g., Fruits and Snacks leading the way).
- Sales by Outlet Size: Tracking total revenue generated by Small, Medium, and High-sized outlets.
- Sales Trend by Establishment Year: Analyzing how total sales have evolved over time and correlating performance with the year an outlet was established.

**3. Product & Category KPIs**
These KPIs focus on specific product characteristics.
- Sales by Fat Content: Comparing the revenue generated by Low Fat vs Regular items.
- Sales by Outlet Tier (Tier 1, 2, 3): Tracking sales performance across predefined geographical or operational groupings.

# Project Insight
- Revenue Concentration: Supermarket Type 1 ($787K) drives nearly two-thirds (65%) of total sales, creating significant business risk due to over-reliance.
- Size Inefficiency: High Size Outlets ($248K) underperform compared to Medium ($507K) and Small ($444K) stores, indicating poor conversion of large capacity to sales.
- Tier 3 Growth: Tier 3 Outlet Locations lead in sales ($472K), showing high untapped potential in these emerging/high-density markets.
- Product Priority: Regular fat content items ($776K) outsell Low Fat items ($425K) by a 2:1 margin, confirming higher customer demand for standard products

# Recommendations
- Optimize Low-Performing Supermarkets: Invest in Supermarket Type 2 (highest Avg Sales: $142) and Type 3 to de-risk dependence on Type 1.
- Fix High-Size Outlets: Conduct a rapid audit on the High Size Outlets to improve their efficiency, potentially by adjusting inventory levels or physical flow to match the superior performance of Medium stores.
- Expand in Tier 3: Prioritize budget for new dark store expansion in Tier 3 locations, utilizing the efficient operating model of Medium-sized stores.
- Refine Inventory Strategy: Re-evaluate stocking to increase inventory of Regular fat content items in high-performing outlets to maximize turnover based on consumer preference.
